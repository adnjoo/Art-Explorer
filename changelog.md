Cannot set headers after they are sent error - fixed with [??](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7042340/error-cant-set-headers-after-they-are-sent-to-the-client) wrapped try catch around large code block. changed hard-coded value for artist sent in front-end.


nice to have - add loading icon for api load
n2h - assign rating to favorite artist/ art-pieces
